        <h2>The basics!</h2>
        <p>My name is Matt Heffley. I'm 26 years old. I was born on December 18, 1992 in a little town called Port Charlotte in southern Florida where i lived my entire life until a few years ago when I moved to North Carolina where I currently live in a little town called Southport.</p>

        <h2>Hobbies & Intrest</h2>
        <p>In my freetime I like to play with my dog. She is a 5 year old black lab named Mia who I have had since she was 6 weeks old. If im not playing with my dog im usually sitting at my computer playing video games or trying to learn a little more about coding. Sometimes I'll go to the park with a few friends to play some basketball or down to the pier to go fishing but not as often as I would like.</p>

        <h2>Past work experiences</h2>
        <p>My very first job was at Long John Silvers for a little over a year until. I then moved to a fast food place called Charlies Grilled Subs where I worked for 4 years and moved into a supervisor position. I then got a job at a glass plant lifting glass all day and sloting them into carts where I also moved into a supervisor position. I worked there for 4 years until I moved to North Carolina and got a job at a woodmill where I mostly just ran wood through a saw.</p>

        <h2>How and why I got into coding</h2>
        <p>A friend of mine who is a front end developer for a living is the one who introduced me into coding and I immediately loved it. I really enjoy the challenge of coding and the problem solving it takes to figure out even the most minor of things. It make you consistantly learn on a daily basis. I've saved up about 7 to 9 months worth of rent in order to persue this as a full time career. I'm not giving up until I've achieved that goal!</p>
